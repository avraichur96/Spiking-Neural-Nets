# Spiking-Neural-Nets
A personal playground for learning spiking neural networks that mimic neuronal behavior more accurately compared to that of an Artificial Neural Network.

The first part only includes introduction to the rate encoding neuron and further work yet to be done. The video for the spiking input layer has been uploaded as a separate file under this repo
